            <p id="d0e27">The NISO JATS 1.0 Preview Stylesheets package includes stylesheets that produce formatted
               previews of documents encoded in XML using the NISO JATS (Journal Article Tag Suite)
               vocabulary. Previews in both HTML and PDF format (via XSL-FO) are supported. Most generic
                       Journal Publishing structures are supported, subject to the assumptions and limitations
                       described in this document.
            </p>
            <p id="d0e29">The primary purpose of the stylesheets is to support version 1.0 of the Publishing ("blue")
                       tag set of NISO JATS, but they will also work on data valid to the related tag sets JATS 1.0
                       Authoring ("orange") and NLM Journal Publishing ("blue") or Authoring ("orange") versions
                       2.3 and 3.0.
            </p>
            <p id="d0e31">The documentation included in this package, namely this <i>Users' Guide</i>, the
                         <i>Quick Start Guide</i>, and the <i>Technical Documentation</i>, can
                       serve as examples of the tagging style supported; they are all encoded in NISO JATS
                       Publishing XML, with HTML and PDF presentation versions generated using the preview
                       stylesheets.
            </p>
            <p id="d0e42">Assuming the user already has valid JATS (Publishing) 1.0 data, the most important
                       consideration regarding application of these stylesheets regards the format of bibliographic
                       citation information in the input and the bibliographic format desired for those citations
                       in the output. Citations tagged using <tt>mixed-citation</tt> and provided
                       with appropriate punctuation in the input (called here "formatted citations") are handled
                       correctly by the stylesheets in this package. Citations tagged without punctuation, using
                         <tt>element-citation</tt> ("unformatted citations") can also be handled:
                       this distribution includes stylesheets which format such citations in the user's choice of
                       two formats: NLM/Pubmed, and APA.
            </p>
            <p id="d0e50">In addition, this package also demonstrates how pre- and post-processing steps connected
                       together in pipelines may achieve other processing goals, both preview and production. These
                       include processing OASIS (CALS) tables and handling tagging intended to optimize outputs for
                       different media (such as web and print).
            </p>
            <p id="d0e52">For a more precise description of the technical dependencies of these stylesheets, along
                       with documentation of alternative ways to deploy and apply them and of how to extend and
                       modify them, users should consult the <i>Technical Documentation</i>. That
                       document also includes a fuller specification of the formatted and unformatted citation
                       formats supported by this package.

                       however, there are limitations in their handling of of variant patterns of tagging and of

                       necessarily mean "incorrect", and where local practice has evolved to meet particular local
                       processing requirements, these stylesheets may <i>and should</i> be altered or

                  <p id="d0e490">In the parlance of document markup, "floating" can refer to two distinct things. If a
                                 rendering application is trusted, at runtime, to determine (and presumably optimize) the
                                 precise position on the page of an object, this object is said to "float". A figure, for
                                 example, may be allowed to float, while a graphic appearing in a paragraph is not (it is
                                 anchored to its place in the flow of text); similarly a boxed text may be allowed to
                                 float, or it may be anchored, depending on whether its exact placement on the page is
                                 important to its meaning. But the term is also used to refer to objects (such as figures
                                 and tables) that are encoded in the source data -- but not necessarily rendered -- apart
                                 from the flow of the text, typically by gathering them into a group at the end of the
                                 document. Such "floating" objects may be displayed there, or moved by the application to
                                 fixed (anchored) positions, or allowed to "float" in the first sense.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d0e492">The first feature in JATS tagging is controlled through the use of
                                   <tt>position</tt> attributes on objects that may be placed in this way
                                 by the formatter. These elements include <tt>boxed-text</tt>,
                                   <tt>chem-struct-wrap</tt>, <tt>fig</tt>,

                                 the <tt>floats-group</tt> element, where such objects may be gathered.

                                 Similarly, it is possible (although not ordinary) for an object to be placed inside

                                 in the data, the formatting stylesheets assume the value 'float', both out of respect
                                 for the semantics specified by the formal document model, and in order to prevent
                                 different formatting when the DTD is used from when it is not.

                                 encoded with <tt>xref</tt> elements, like any other cross-reference. The
                                 latter style of encoding is said in the Journal Publishing documentation to be
                                 appropriate for "end notes" as opposed to footnotes as such.
                                   <tt>fn-group</tt> is permitted in a number of places, including within
                                 the article back matter and in several other locations where footnotes are commonly
                                 grouped in journal articles.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d0e754">These stylesheets will support either approach to encoding footnotes. In the HTML
                                 preview output, all footnotes encoded inline are grouped together in a section called
                                 "Notes" appearing at the end of the document. In the PDF, footnotes encoded inline are
                                 formatted at the foot of the page. In both cases, footnotes grouped in
                                   <tt>fn-group</tt> or in <tt>author-notes</tt> appear
                                 collected together where the <tt>fn-group</tt> or
                                   <tt>author-notes</tt> appears. This will usually be inside the back
                                 matter, but it can also occur in other places such as in the front matter,
                                   <tt>boxed-text</tt> or <tt>table-wrap-foot</tt>.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d0e774">Note that the two approaches (loose <tt>fn</tt> elements and
                                   <tt>fn</tt> within <tt>fn-group</tt>) may be combined, but
                                 this is inadvisable unless footnotes are numbered in the data, since it may result in
                                 two distinct sets of footnote numbering. It is best to encode footnotes all one way or
                                 all the other. Generally, if you use <tt>fn</tt> elements within mixed
                                 content, do not also use <tt>fn-group</tt>. If you use
                                   <tt>fn-group</tt>, use it for all footnotes and use
                                   <tt>xref</tt> to provide references to them.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d0e797">Additionally, in the PDF preview, errors will result if inline footnotes appear inside
                                 floating objects (such as boxed text or figures). This is because the XSL-FO formatter
                                 cannot position both a footnote and a floating object together (since when a footnote is
                                 moved to appear on the same page as a float, the page layout determining where the float
                                 can be placed may also be thrown off). This restriction means, in effect, that if you
                                 have footnotes in your floating objects, you must locate the footnotes inside an
                                   <tt>fn-group</tt>, and reference them with <tt>xref</tt>,
                                 rather than using <tt>fn</tt> elements inline.

                            material, etc. are to be labelled, they must be labelled in the data. Labels provided in
                            the data (<tt>label</tt> elements) are displayed with the elements they
                            label; the same label content also appears in cross-references that point to those
                            elements when a cross-reference element (<tt>xref</tt> element) is given as
                            empty. (When an <tt>xref</tt> element has text content, it is used as the
                            text of the cross-reference, irrespective of whether a label appears with its target.)
               </p>
               <p id="d0e840">This approach is meant to be as transparent and easy to understand as possible: rather
                            than assume any autolabeling method and format, it assumes that when labels are wanted on
                            content, they will be provided explicitly in the source data, and that when a
                            cross-reference is made to an object, it will either have content of its own (which can
                            serve as anchoring text), or its target will have an explicit label that can be used
                            unaltered as the text in the cross-reference.
               </p>
               <p id="d0e842">There are two exceptions to this principle: numbering is provided for footnotes
                              (<tt>fn</tt> elements) and for references (<tt>ref</tt>
                            elements) when they do not have explicit labels, as these elements' primary purpose is
                            their systematic cross-referencing, and in most instances they will not function without
                            labels. In both cases, explicit labels (<tt>label</tt> elements or, in the
                            case of footnotes, <tt>symbol</tt> attributes) will override autogenerated
                            labels, allowing for projects to control these values in their data when necessary.
               </p>
               <p id="d0e856">In all cases, to ensure legible and transparent output, warning messages may be generated
                            for unlabelled elements where labels are needed (due to an empty cross-reference pointing
                            to the element). This is described further below.
               </p>
               <p id="d0e858">When generated for footnotes and references, automated numbers are assigned based on the
                            order of their appearance in the document, not of first references to them. (Nor are
                              <tt>ref</tt> elements sorted to reflect their order of first reference.)
                            Accordingly, in the PDF output, since footnotes are placed based on the location of the
                              <tt>fn</tt> element in the document, a cross-reference can be made to a
                            footnote that will appear on a different page. This also means that if footnote A appears
                            before footnote B in the document, a reference to footnote B will appear out of sequence
                            if it appears before footnote A does. The easiest ways to avoid both these problems are
                            (a) to use footnotes as endnotes (group them in <tt>fn-group</tt> in the
                            back matter) and confirm that they are placed in order of first reference; or (b) use
                            inline footnotes consistently (resulting in actual footnotes in the PDF) and make sure
                            that in every case, an <tt>fn</tt> element appears <i>before</i>
                            any other (second or subsequent) reference to the same footnote.

               <p id="d0e875">These stylesheets do not accommodate a practice of redundant tagging, whereby a footnote
                            encoded inline is also provided with an <tt>xref</tt> (cross-reference)
                            element to that footnote. If an <tt>fn</tt> element is used in line, a
                            reference will appear for it. Cross-references to footnotes should be used only for end
                            notes (<tt>fn</tt> elements in <tt>fn-group</tt>) or in cases
                            where more than one reference is made to a single footnote.

                                often have to be made. When this occurs with the provided stylesheets, users have the

                                back on manual formatting using <tt>mixed-citation</tt>.
